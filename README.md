# Parallel Programming Features

Similar to the programming language "go", it is very easy to create threads. However, instead of the keyword "go" the keyword is "shadow clone jitsu".

# Language Features


Simple imperative language featuring
- Loops
- Functions
- Variables


# Goals

- Create parser
- Compile llvm
- Implement multi-threading
- Learn about Naruto

# Specifications

Parser will be in c++, as Krist hates all languages that are not c++ or German. 

Target backend will be LLVM.

# Milestones

By midterm: Have a parser that works for a subset of the lanugage.  Hopefully be able to compile LLVM also.

By Final: Implement multithreading and Naruto theme.
