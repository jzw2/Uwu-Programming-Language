# Overview

Uwu is a python-ish type of programming language with a bunch of random keywords. 
Uwu is dynamicaly typed. 
It is case sensitive, and is not whitespace sensitive, however it new line sensitive.  Instead of a semicolon, a new line indicates the end of a statement, similar to python. A double new line indicates the end of a block.  This is used in place of curly braces.  (Krist came up with this.)


# Comments

Comments use C-Style comments that  `(OwO)` and end with `(T_T)`

## Example

```
(OwO)

Do you wanna build a snowman?

(T_T)
```


# Functions

Functions declarations have to end in `no jutsu` and are called using `no jutsu` as well.  

A return statement is used `sayanora` and terminated with `chan`

## Example

```
add_1 n no jutsu
  sayanora n + 1 chan

add_1 5 no jutsu (O_O) Should end up with 6 (T_T)
```


# Variables 

Variables are case-sensitive, alpha numeric characters. Varibles do not need to be declared before usage, similar to python. Variable assignment is done by saying the identifier `wa`, the value, then terminated with `desu`.

## Example

```
naruto wa 25 desu (O_O) Sets 'naruto' to 25 (T_T) 

```


# Conditional

If statements start with `nani` then the conditional expression, then a new line.  The if statement is terminated using two new lines.

```
nani 1 + 1 == 2
  sasuke wa 77 desu

```


# Loops

The only loop available is the while loop, which is similar to the if statement, but the keyword is `doki`


```
sakura wa 0 desu
doki sakura < 50
  sakura wa sakura + 1 desu

```
